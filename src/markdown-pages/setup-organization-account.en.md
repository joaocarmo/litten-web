## What is an organization account?

An organization account is just a regular account and there are no special
features reserved for organizations.

Organization accounts are easily identified by a blue `O` next to the account's
name. It lets users know that they are interacting with an organization rather
than an individual.

If you represent a shelter, a clinic, or any other type of organization, then
you should enable this to make it clear to other users.

## How do I set my profile as an organization?

It's very easy to do so. From the `Profile & Definitions` screen, you can
access your account's details and enable the option `Organization profile`.

| Profile & Definitions                                         | Account Details                                         |
