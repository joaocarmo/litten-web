## How do I change my password?

We're currently working to make this option available from the user's profile
definitions. Meanwhile, you can change your password by following these steps:

1. Sign out of Litten (from the profile definitions screen)
1. Go to the Sign in screen (from the welcome screen)
1. Type in a wrong password (but use the correct email address)
1. An option should appear in case you have forgotten your password
1. Follow the steps as if you've forgotten your password

## I made a mistake creating a new Litten. How do I fix it?

Unfortunately, we don't have the option to make changes to a Litten yet. It's
somewthing that we want to introduce as soon as possible. As of now, the only
option is to delete it and create a new one.

## How can I contact the Litten Team?

You can reach us through the email [help@litten.app][helpmail].
