## How do I change my password?

We're currently working to make this option available from the user's profile
definitions. Meanwhile, you can change your password by following these steps:

1. Sign out of Litten (from the profile definitions screen)
1. Go to the Sign in screen (from the welcome screen)
1. Type in a wrong password (but use the correct email address)
1. An option should appear in case you have forgotten your password
1. Follow the steps as if you've forgotten your password

## I made a mistake creating a new Litten. How do I fix it?

Unfortunately, we don't have the option to make changes to a Litten yet. It's
somewthing that we want to introduce as soon as possible. As of now, the only
option is to delete it and create a new one.

## Why don't I receive notifications?

At the moment, we don't support remote push notifications. We count on you to
check in on the app from time to time and see if you've updates or new messages.
We know this might not be ideal and are currently working on improving the
overall experience.
