## How do I change my password?

We're currently working to make this option available from the user's profile
settings. Meanwhile, you can change your password using these steps:

1. Sign out of Litten (from the profile settings screen)
1. Go to the sign in screen (from the welcome screen)
1. Type in a wrong password (but use the correct email address)
1. The option to change your password will appear
1. Follow the steps to change your password

## I made a mistake creating a new Litten. How do I fix it?

Unfortunately, we don't have the option to make changes to a Litten yet. It's
something we want to introduce as soon as possible. As of now, the only
option is to delete it and create a new one.

## Why didn't I receive a notification?

At the moment, we don't support remote push notifications. We count on you to
check the app from time to time and see if you have updates or new messages.
We know this might not be ideal and are currently working on improving the
overall experience.

## What personal data do we collect?

We collect only the essential personal data needed to deliver our services to
you. This includes your email address, name, and profile picture. Additionally,
we gather information regarding your interactions with the app, like the Littens
you create and the messages you send.

We commit to not sharing your personal data with third-party entities nor using
it for advertising purposes. Our use of your data is strictly limited to
providing you with our services.

For more details, please review our [Privacy Policy][privacy].

## How can I request my personal data?

Currently, there is no feature within the app to directly request your personal
data. However, you can contact us, and we will assist you in accessing your
data. Learn how to reach us [here](#how-can-i-contact-the-litten-team).

## How do I delete my account?

You have the option to delete your account directly within the app. Navigate to
your profile settings and select the option to delete your account. You will be
asked to confirm your decision, after which your account will be permanently
removed.

Should you prefer, you can also contact us directly for account deletion. Find
out how to reach us [here](#how-can-i-contact-the-litten-team).
