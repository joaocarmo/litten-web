## How do I change my password?

We're currently working to make this option available from the user's profile
settings. Meanwhile, you can change your password using these steps:

1. Sign out of Litten (from the profile settings screen)
1. Go to the sign in screen (from the welcome screen)
1. Type in a wrong password (but use the correct email address)
1. The option to change your password will appear
1. Follow the steps to change your password

## I made a mistake creating a new Litten. How do I fix it?

Unfortunately, we don't have the option to make changes to a Litten yet. It's
something we want to introduce as soon as possible. As of now, the only
option is to delete it and create a new one.

## Why don't I receive notifications?

At the moment, we don't support remote push notifications. We count on you to
check the app from time to time and see if you have updates or new messages.
We know this might not be ideal and are currently working on improving the
overall experience.
