## What is a Litten?

Litten is what we call our furry friends within the app. You can adopt a litten,
breed a litten, and post or search for a missing litten.

## What do I need to create a new litten?

You need a verified email address. We enforce this in order to prevent "bots"
and "spammers" from creating false littens. This helps to maintain a level of
quality littens within our community.

You also need to provide some relevant information about your new litten:

1. At least, one photo
1. Name
1. Species (e.g., _Cat_)
1. Type (e.g., _Adopt_)
1. Story, some background information or a funny moment you shared together
1. Location

## Where can I create a new litten?

You can do it from the `New litten` screen. To go there, simply press the `+`
button on the bottom navigation bar.
